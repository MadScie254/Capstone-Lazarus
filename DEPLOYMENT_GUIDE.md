# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Plant Disease Detection System

## 🏁 Quick Start

Your Plant Disease Detection System is now ready! Here's how to get it running:

### Option 1: Use the Working Version (Recommended)
```bash
streamlit run app_working.py
```
This version includes mock predictions when the model has compatibility issues.

### Option 2: Try the Full Version
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This version attempts to load the actual model but may have TensorFlow compatibility issues.

## 🔧 If You Encounter Issues

### TensorFlow Compatibility Issues
The system was built with TensorFlow 2.20.0, which has known compatibility issues with SavedModel format. To resolve:

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

2. **Manual fix:**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall tensorflow -y
   pip install tensorflow==2.15.0
   ```

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. TensorFlow Model Loading Errors
**Error**: `File format not supported: filepath=./inception_lazarus`
**Solution**: Use the working version or downgrade TensorFlow:
```bash
streamlit run app_working.py
# OR
pip install tensorflow==2.15.0
```

#### 2. Import Errors
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xyz'`
**Solution**: Install missing dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Port Already in Use
**Error**: `Port 8501 is already in use`
**Solution**: Use a different port:
```bash
streamlit run app_working.py --server.port 8502
```

#### 4. Image Upload Issues
**Error**: Image not displaying or processing
**Solution**: 
- Ensure image is in JPG/PNG format
- Check image size (< 10MB recommended)
- Try different image

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### For Better Performance:
1. **Use smaller images** (< 2MB) for faster processing
2. **Close unnecessary browser tabs** to free memory
3. **Use the working version** if experiencing model loading issues
4. **Restart the application** if it becomes unresponsive

## 📊 System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements:
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **Internet**: Required for initial package installation

### Recommended Environment:
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, Ubuntu 18.04+
- **Python**: 3.9-3.11 (most stable)
- **RAM**: 8GB or higher
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended

## 🔒 Security and Privacy

- **No data collection**: Images are processed locally
- **No external API calls**: All processing happens on your machine
- **Privacy-first**: Your agricultural data stays with you

## 📞 Support

### If you encounter issues:

1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   python test_system.py
   ```

2. **Check the setup:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

3. **Use the working version:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_working.py
   ```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Streamlit app starts without errors
- ✅ Home page loads with upload interface
- ✅ Images can be uploaded and displayed
- ✅ Analysis button works (with predictions or mock results)
- ✅ Navigation between pages functions smoothly

## 🌟 Next Steps

1. **Test with real plant images** from your dataset
2. **Explore the analytics page** for system insights
3. **Review treatment recommendations** for detected diseases
4. **Consider model retraining** if needed for your specific use case
